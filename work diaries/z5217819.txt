Week 1
- What was finished:
    - In week 1, we formed our groups and set-up our JIRA and GitHub accounts.
    - We have also created a Google Docs where we have written up the background of our project proposal.
    - We have made significant progress on the storyboards using Balsamiq, mapping out what we'd like the user interface to look like, taking in consideration of design principles for better user experience.
    - We had a team meeting on Sunday night to talk about our current progress, and also improved on our existing work together.

- What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome:
    - The main obstacle was to ensure that our storyboard conforms with UI/UX principles, as well as considering of heuristics and usability goals. 

- What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress
    and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered:
    -   We have finished everything that we planned to achieve.
- What is planned for the next period
    -   We plan to polish up the storyboards next week as well as start on the following sections of the proposal (user stories, etc.).

Week 2
-  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - We planned to begin working on the user story section of our proposal and polish our storyboard.

- What was finished:
    - This week, we mostly finished with our user stories.
    - During our lab in week 2, we've made significant progress, writing up acceptance criterias for each user stories.
    - Initially, I had written up some user stories, which we then later categorised into epics in our week 2 lab, and have also added them into our JIRA.
    - We added story points to each user story in JIRA.
    - We have also decided on using Spring Boot, React and SQLite3 for this project.
    - We have finalised our storyboard, made some minor touches on areas where we have missed as we were writing user stories.
    - We made a start to the system architecture diagram which we would finish by the end of week 3.

- What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome:
    - We did not experience any obstacles.

- What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress
    and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered:
    -   We have finished everything that we planned to achieve.

- What is planned for the next period:
    - In week 3, I plan to polish up our entire proposal and have it ready before our next meeting.

Week 3
-  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - We planned to polish and finish up our entire proposal.

- What was finished:
    - This week we have got every section required into our proposal.
    - I added a table which demonstrated how our user stories had covered each project objective.
    - We have written up the novel functionalities our system will provide.
    - As determining if each user story is covered in our storyboards may be quite challenging, we have decided to create a table that states the relevant user stories in each storyboard frame.
    - We have finalised the system architecture diagrams and storyboards that we worked on last week.
    - We have also decided to write up the system architecture descriptions as we believed that it would make things clearer.
    - I have assisted in finalising the proposal ensuring that every section meets the criteria.

- What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome:
    - We did not experience any obstacles.

- What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress:
    - Everything was completed on time.

- What is planned for the next period:
    - In week 4, we plan to begin our first sprint for our project. We plan to implement the authentication features of our system.

Week 4
-  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    We had planned to begin our first sprint for our project. Sprint 1 involves implementing the authentication features of our system

- What was finished:
    - This week, we have mostly implemented the authentication features of our system.
    - Initially, I experimented working with frontend, creating the design for our navigation bar.
    - Later, I then set-up our backend and had it connected to an SQLite3 database so that my team can begin working on implementing features.
    - I have implemented the initial structure of our system including setting up the classes for our entity, controllers, repositories and services.
    - I then worked on getting register diner and eatery functional so that my team can have an idea how things would be implemented.

- What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome:
    - Lack of consistency in design when implementing a feature.
    - Conflicting views when deciding on the structure.
    - Branches were made before backend was properly set up leading to a lot of issues in terms of git management.
    - We seek to improve on communicating our ideas in the following weeks.

- What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress:
    - We have managed to implement Sprint 1 features for backend on time. Localstorage is yet to be implemented frontend.

- What is planned for the next period:
    - We plan to improve the design of our code by Monday to ensure that future features can be implemented with ease.
    - We also plan to begin our next sprint which includes working on profile related features.

Week 5
-  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - We planned to improve the design of our code by Monday to ensure that future features can be implemented with ease.
    - We had also planned to begin sprint 2 which includes working on profile related features.

- What was finished:
    - This week, I have improved the structure of our database backend so that cuisines and reviews will have a table.
    - I came up with an API table so that team members working in backend or frontend will know what to expect from HTTP routes.
    - This week, I have worked on the features surrounding creating/editing/removing reviews, as well as implementing a return structure for eatery profile details.
    - I have made minor adjustments to the expected response data so that it will work well when used in frontend.

- What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome:
    - We did not experience many obstacles in backend as we communicated what we plan to do quite well to avoid any conflicts.
    However, initially, we had trouble converting and parsing JSONobject as data that we could work with as we were used to using
    the databind library which mapped JSON to POJO. This was resolved promptly using an object mapper.
    The frontend workload seemed like a lot more so to overcome this, I worked closely with frontend to ensure that any issues were resolved as soon as possible.

- What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress:
    - All backend features were completed on time. However, update eatery profile in frontend was not completed so that it will be moved to the next sprint.

- What is planned for the next period:
    - We plan to implement mostly the features surrounding eatery voucher distribution in the following sprint.

Week 6
-  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - Last week, we have planned to implement mostly the features surrounding eatery voucher distribution in the Sprint 3.

- What was finished:
    - We have managed to implement all the planned features including a couple extra features that were included in Sprint 4.
    - The features implemented in backend included: create, edit, delete, verify, book and list diner vouchers.
    The eatery profile list of vouchers was also updated to include actual vouchers rather than placeholder values.

- What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome:
    - The project objective having a lot of edge cases that weren't considered carefully initially which required a lot of structural adjustments as we implemented each new feature.
    However, we have managed to overcome this and getting the structure working.
    - The JAVA date API isn't designed very well leading to issues with timezones (Date doesn't deal with timezones).
    To overcome this, I have decided to offset the times so that times are compared in the same timezone.

- What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress:
    - Everything that we had planned to finish in this sprint were finished on time.

- What is planned for the next period:
    - Next week we plan to begin sprint 5. However, before we start doing this, I plan to improve our code design in backend to remove a lot of repetitive code.

Week 7
-  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - Last week, I have planned to improve code design in the backend to remove repetitive code. We have also planned to begin sprint 5 which involves search and recommendation.

- What was finished:
    - This week, I managed to clean up a lot of the repetitive code early in the week, making functions for repetitive code and putting them into their respective utils class.
    - I have also made some plans surrounding how recommendation will be implemented later in the week, however, this is not final and most likely subject to change in the future.
    -   As we have finished implementing the features in Sprint 4 ahead of time, we spent this week mostly polishing things up and also slowly worked on Sprint 5.
    - Kevin had made a good start on implementing search which I have reviewed.
    
- What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome:
    - We did not face any obstacles this week as it mostly involved code cleaning around already functional features,
    however, testing our software manually seemed to take a while so we plan to work on creating tests to automate this.

- What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress:
    - Everything that we had planned to finish was essentially completed on time.

- What is planned for the next period:
    - Next week, we plan to finalise recommendation and search features and also create some unit tests.

Week 8
-  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - Last week, we have planned to implement and finalise both recommendation and search features in Sprint 5. We have also planned to create some unit tests using JUnit5.

- What was finished:
    - This week, I have managed to implement a recommendation system.
    - I have also touched up on the response data returned for both search and eatery details so that required data is given for the view.
    - Create review was updated so that it better match what is required in the project objectives i.e. diners cannot create reviews until they have a discount voucher.
    - I have implemented sorting of eateries by new, rating and distance.
    - William had created some unit tests for our backend features.

- What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome:
	- Object mapper/gson seemed to not work when mapping the JSON response to a JAVA model class. Kept having NPE. As a substitute, I used a JSON parser to process
	the response.
	- Slow response speed for distance sorting. As I was sending a new API request for each eatery, this made it extremely slow as each request would normally take
	400ms for this API. After realising the speed, I sought ways to perhaps make it faster such as using parallel HTTP connections or some sort of caching system.
	Soon later, I found out that I could pass multiple addresses in a single request. This had improved the response speed greatly.

- What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress:
    - We had completed everything we planned to do in Sprint 5 on time.

- What is planned for the next period:
    - Next week, we plan to:
        - work on our final report,
        - add more tests,
        - improve on code design both frontend and backend,
        - and improve on the UI of our application.

Week 9
-  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - We had also planned to improve on our backend/frontend code design and the UI of our application.
    - We had planned to add more backend tests.
    - We had planned to work on our final report this week.

- What was finished:
    - I was able to improve on our backend code design by using the VSCode linter.
    - I have renamed some functions so that they better describe what they're doing.
    - I have renamed some files so that features can be located with greater ease.
    - I have also noticed that search was always returning results based on best match, even when none of the results were close matches.
    I have fixed this by adding a threshold to search.
    - I have also written up the javadocs for each controller, utility, and service methods so that future users working with our code can better
    understand what each function does and returns.
    - William had further written some additional tests for backend which I have reviewed.
    - Ash and Ben had worked closely improving on frontend code and our application's UI design.
    - We have got what we've wanted in the final report and hope to polish it before 10pm on Monday.

- What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome:
    - The main obstacle we've faced this week was finalising our application - which proved to be quite a challenging task as there is an
    unending list of things that could be improved. During our Wednesday meeting, we discussed this - setting a day to finalise our application by (Saturday) to leave time for us to
    work on and complete our final report. Our obstacles mostly stemmed from time management, so we've worked harder and managed complete what we had planned to do.

- What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress:
    - We had completed everything we planned to do on time.

- What is planned for the next period:
    - Finalise and submit our report + code before Monday 10pm.
    - Prepare for our final presentation.
    - Complete peer assessment.
