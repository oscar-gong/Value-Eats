Week 1
- The group was formed + JIRA, google doc and github repo were set up 
- Contributed to the background research in the drawbacks of existing work that our application will aim to offer on the google doc
- I did the initial storyboarding for the user (diner) side of the interface e.g. User Profile, Eatery Profile, SignUp/Login
- One of the issues we ran into was that initially our storyboard wireframes were set in a 1:1 aspect ratio. We changed the size of a lot of wireframes to closely represent a 16:9 aspect ratio and adjusted the UI elements to fit in order to have a more realistic indication of our UI on a browser. 
- Assisted in making changes to the storyboard to make UI fixes on Sunday night with the rest of the group 

Future:
- I plan to put together the storyboard to show the flow of the wireframes in the coming weeks. 
- As a team, we plan to have user stories completed by next week Saturday and discuss it on the same day at 5pm.

Week 2
- I set up draw.io for our storyboard and did an initial draft of connecting the wireframes. As a team, we reviewed the wireframes and noted that we were missing some critical components such as an email address login for eateries. We continued to make minor fixes and changes to the storyboard.
- After completing our user stories, we decided to move it into JIRA. We added user stories, their corresponding acceptance criteria and story points under epics. We made some adjustments to our user stories as we realised that some stories were more suited to belong under other epics. We were also able to become more familiar with the interface. 
- We also decided what user stories we wanted to accomplish by our upcoming Wednesday lab so we can make progress on the technical side of the project
- Discussed system architecture and what technologies/languages we are planning to use in more depth
- We chose SQLite due to its simplicity over PostgreSQL

Future:
- I plan to finalise the storyboard and the proposal before this week's upcoming lab
- If there is additional time, I plan to start on the frontend

Week 3
- Our goal was to finish the entire proposal and finalise it for submission.
- We were able to successfully complete our goal and submit our proposal
- Over the past week, I worked on various components of our proposal such as finalising the storyboard, writing a description for the presentation layer of the system architecture, mapping etc. 
- As a team, we all ensured that our proposal looked presentable and checked through it to ensure that we met the marking criteria 
- Obstacles that we faced:
    - Splitting our user stories up into epics
        - We initially had a mix of "As a eatery owner" and "As a diner" within the user management epic
        - After discussion, we were able to come to a final decision of splitting the eatery side of the interface into an epic and diner side into another epic
        - User stories for both were written as "As a user" such as login/logout and remained in the user management epic
- What was not finished:
    - Everything was finished within the proposal and we were all satisfied with it
    - However, We have not made a start on our first sprint. We intend to this beginning on Monday. 
- What is planned for the next period:
    - I plan to focus more on the frontend of our authentication features
    - We plan to implement the user stories we have placed in our first sprint which are mainly authentication features
    - If there is additional time, we will implement more features

Week 4
- What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - setup the frontend, backend and database
    - complete Sprint 1 (authentication) by the end of this week which included login, register and logout 

- What we finished:
    - database created, login/registerDiner/registerEatery/logout completed
    - I worked mainly on the frontend pages such as registerDiner and registerEatery
    - We were able to successfully connect the frontend to the backend, make requests and pass data into the database

- Obstacles that we faced:
    - In terms of backend, there were some disparities in opinions on system design due to a lack of consistency. 
    - Creating branches too early on when the backend was not completely set up properly caused issues with merging
    - Branching became slightly chaotic and we had different versions on different branches, which we could work to improve on in the next few sprints

- What was not finished:
    - localstorage of token at the frontend, adding the feature of eateries being allowed to upload photos at registration of their food (plan to finish it off on Monday)

- What is planned for the next period:
    - make a start on sprint 2 which includes creating the eatery profile, diner profile and reviews
    - refactor code if necessary
