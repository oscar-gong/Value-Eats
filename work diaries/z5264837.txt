        - Proposal: Technical Depth, Scale, Reporting Format
            - Discussed about what were planning to use
            - We are planning to leverage Java's SpringBoot, React and SQLite
    - What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
        - SQLite vs AWS RDS
            - Discussed about the advantages and disadvantages of both
            - SQLite could provide faster iterations by its ease of use such as deleting the database or updating the schema
            - Postgres could allow a centralised data pool so we could replicate test data
            - In the end, we chose SQLite as it was simpler to develop with, and we did not have to overengineer with AWS' potentially billable service
    - What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered
        - No issues as we achieved more than expected

        - Sprint #1
            - Potential to start on the authentication sprint

            - Required drawing out potential issues within the given scope
    - What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered
        - Starting sprint 1
            - We planned to commence work on the project in advance to help us further understand the specifications and hence the proposal
            - We were unable to commence work as we were focused on improving the quality of the proposal directly rather than indirectly through development
            - This will not impact our overall project progress as this was an extension goal which we would have liked to achieve in order to reduce future workload
    - What is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)
        - As it is the start of a project, there will be a lot of setting up of both environments and machines
        - Sprint 1

        - Scalability vs Fit For Purpose
            - Tokens: Many Tokens vs One Token Per User
                - Chosen Design: One token per user as it was simpler
                - Does not properly allow multiple sessions per user
                    - Token is deactivated once a user logouts
                    - Previous token is deactivated once a user logs in
            - User Id Generation: Race Condition
                - Chosen Design: To ignore as we do not have a massive userbase
                - Does not allow multiple users to safely register at the same time
        - Lack of specification
            - Differing ideas on
                - Database design
                - Object oriented programming
                - API design
            - Caused issues as changes were made half way through which caused other edits to be required
            - Through discussion and better planning, especially in the future we can avoid this issue
        - Branching
            - Base branch become a feature branch
            - Caused issues as a lot of changes were occuring which created conflicts
            - We ended up merging core templates into master so we could have the template built
    - What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered
        - Sprint 1 was not finished
            - A lot of differing ideas of how to do a specific task, especially as it was the start where there was a lot of core development
            - This is a small set back and we are able to catchup after finalising our core discussions, especially as the workload was purposefully small
            - We will complete the remaining tickets before the lab to ensure we meet client deadlines
            - Last sprint's tickets will be done in addition to the next sprint's planned goal
    - What is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)
        - Sprint 2
            - Development of profiles and their associated management
        - Last week's remaining tasks
